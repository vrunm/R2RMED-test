{"id": "0", "text": "Claim in article about why insects are attracted to light\nIn this article they are addressing the reason insects are attracted to light when they say\nHeat radiation as an attractive component is refuted by the effect of LED lighting, which supplies negligible infrared radiation yet still entraps vast numbers of insects.\nI don't see why attraction to LEDs shows they're not seeking heat. Could they for example be evolutionarily programmed to associate light with heat? So that even though they don't encounter heat near/on the LEDs they still \"expect\" to?", "hy_doc": "Certainly! Hereâ€™s a passage to help address the claim and the reasoning behind it:\n\n---\n\nIn the article, the claim that insects are attracted to light rather than heat radiation is supported by the observation that LED lighting, which emits negligible infrared radiation, still entices vast numbers of insects. This finding challenges the traditional notion that insects are primarily attracted to heat radiation. However, it's important to consider other evolutionary and physiological factors that might explain this behavior.\n\nOne possible explanation is that insects have evolved to associate light sources with heat, which typically occurs in nature. Many insects have adapted to seek out light sources as a means to find warmth, especially during cooler periods or at night. Evolutionarily, this association could be deeply ingrained. Even though insects might not encounter heat near or on LED lights, their behavior may be driven by a preprogrammed response to light itself, which they have historically associated with warmth and safety.\n\nThis evolutionary programming could explain why insects continue to be attracted to artificial light sources like LEDs, which do not emit significant heat. The attraction to light could be a survival mechanism that has been honed over time to ensure that insects find suitable environments for feeding, mating, and sheltering, even if these environments do not provide the same level of heat as natural sources.\n\nTherefore, while the presence of light alone, without accompanying heat radiation, does not directly attract insects, the historical association of light with heat and warmth could play a crucial role in driving their behavior. This association likely contributes to the observed phenomenon, even in the absence of significant infrared radiation.\n\n---\n\nThis passage should help clarify the reasoning behind the claim and provide a comprehensive explanation of the possible evolutionary and physiological factors at play.", "doc_id": ["insects_attracted_to_light/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation_0.txt", "insects_attracted_to_light/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation_1.txt", "insects_attracted_to_light/Phototaxis_0.txt", "insects_attracted_to_light/Phototaxis_3.txt", "insects_attracted_to_light/Phototaxis_4.txt"]}

I would think I would use both, it seems much more efficient. Have I always only been breathing out of my right nostril?", "hy_doc": "The phenomenon of only breathing through one nostril at a time is a natural and normal occurrence, and it is not limited to just one side. This asymmetry in nostril usage is due to a physiological process called nasal cycle. The nasal cycle refers to the alternating dilation and constriction of the blood vessels in the nasal passages, which causes one nostril to be more open and functional than the other at any given time. This cycle typically lasts between 2 to 4 hours, and it ensures that both nostrils get an opportunity to rest and stay healthy.\n\nThe nasal cycle is influenced by several factors, including humidity, temperature, and the body's circadian rhythm. When one nostril is more open, it allows for better airflow and easier breathing, while the other nostril may become constricted. This alternation helps keep the nasal passages moisturized and free from allergens and irritants, thereby maintaining good respiratory health.\n\nIt is common to notice this asymmetry, and it is not a sign of any underlying medical condition. In fact, the nasal cycle is an essential mechanism that helps maintain the health and efficiency of your nasal passages. While you might predominantly use one nostril at a particular moment, it is not uncommon for the other nostril to become dominant later in the day or during different activities.\n\nIf you notice that one nostril is consistently more congested or constricted, or if you experience other symptoms such as significant discomfort, persistent nasal discharge, or difficulty breathing through either nostril, it would be wise to consult a healthcare professional. However, in the absence of these symptoms, the occasional use of one nostril over the other is perfectly normal and part of the body's natural respiratory process.", "doc_id": ["breathe_out_of_one_nostril/Nasal_cycle_3.txt", "breathe_out_of_one_nostril/Nasal_cycle_0.txt", "breathe_out_of_one_nostril/Nasal_cycle_1.txt", "breathe_out_of_one_nostril/Nasal_cycle_4.txt", "breathe_out_of_one_nostril/Nasal_cycle_2.txt", "breathe_out_of_one_nostril/Nasal_cycle_5.txt"]}

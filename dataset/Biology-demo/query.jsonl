What's more, he found that this is indeed a\n'nasal cycle', changing every 2.5 hours or so. Of course, the other nostril\nisn't completely blocked, just mostly. If you try, you can feel a very light\npush of air out of the blocked nostril.\n\nThis is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. You can change which\nnostril is closed and which is open by laying on one side to open the opposite\none.\n\nInterestingly, some researchers think that this is the reason we often switch\nthe sides we lay on during sleep rather regularly, as it is more comfortable\nto sleep on the side with the blocked nostril downwards.\n\nAs to why we don't breathe through both nostrils simultaneously, I couldn't\nfind anything that explains it.\n\nSources:  \n[ About 85% of People Only Breathe Out of One Nostril at a Time\n](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/03/about-85-of-people-only-\nbreathe-out-of-one-nostril-at-a-time/)  \n[ Nasal cycle ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cycle)", "body_system": ""}

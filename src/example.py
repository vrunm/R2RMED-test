    "Stack-Biology": '''Post: What does a virus need to transmit through air between humans? For now, the avian flu outbreak is said to stop short of a human pandemic because human-to-human transmission has not been observed. However, people are getting sick from contact with infected animals, and coughing is one of the symptoms. What factors could be preventing airborne transmission, and how would the virus need to change to accomplish it?
Passage:
Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) or haemagglutinin[p] (British English) is a homotrimeric glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza viruses and is integral to its infectivity. Hemagglutinin is a class I fusion protein,[1][2] having multifunctional activity as both an attachment factor and membrane fusion protein. Therefore, HA is responsible for binding influenza viruses to sialic acid on the surface of target cells, such as cells in the upper respiratory tract or erythrocytes,[3] resulting in the internalization of the virus.[4] Additionally, HA is responsible for the fusion of the viral envelope with the late endosomal membrane once exposed to low pH (5.0–5.5).

Post: what are the differences in microsatellites/minisatellites between different people? i know this is a very basic question however neither my textbook nor online resources give me a clear answer. are the differences in minisatellites/microsatellites between people about the number of repeats or the repeating sequence itself? or both?
Passage:
Microsatellites (1 to 10 nucleotides) and minisatellites (> 10 nucleotides) are subcategories of tandem repeats (TRs) that, together with the predominant interspersed repeats (or remnants of transposable elements), make up genomic repetitive regions. TRs are evolutionarily relevant due to their instability. They mutate at rates between 103 and 106 per cell generation i.e., up to 10 orders of magnitude greater than point mutations (Gemayel et al., 2012). Microsatellites, Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR), Short Tandem Repeats (STR) and Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLP) are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. They are widely distributed throughout the genome, especially in the euchromatin of eukaryotes, and coding and non-coding nuclear and organellar DNA (Pérez-Jiménez et al., 2013; Phumichai et al., 2015).

    "Stack-Medical": '''Post: Risks of blood donation with autoimmune diseases People with autoimmune diseases are generally either forbidden or discouraged from donating blood. Example: People who have autoimmune diseases (such as autoimmune thyroid disease, ankylosing spondylitis) are advised not to donate blood. This is because there is a small risk of causing immune system disturbance and symptomatic disease in patients who receive blood from donors with autoimmune diseases. source Is there any more information in the literature about the cases? I'm especially interested in the "causing symptomatic disease in patients who receive blood" part.
Passage:
5.1.4 Thrombocytopenia Individuals with thrombocytopenia should not be accepted as blood donors because of the risk of bleeding at the venepuncture site and because chronic thrombocytopenia may be associated with serious underlying haematological or other systemic disease. A past history of autoimmune thrombocytopenia is not a contraindication to blood donation, even if treated by splenectomy, provided that the prospective donor has been well for five years with no evidence of relapse (64).

Post: Can wearing eyeglasses cause your eyesight to degrade further? I've been told that wearing eyeglasses to correct poor vision can cause your vision to degrade even further. In other words, "Hold off wearing glasses for as long as possible, because once you start, it gets much worse." The claim is that with glasses, the eyes don't have to work as hard to focus and then become "lazier" (for lack of a better term), leading to a vicious cycle of needing more and more correction. Is there any truth to this claim?
Passage:
Myth: Wearing eyeglasses will weaken the eyes: The eyeglasses worn to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or presbyopia will not weaken the eyes any more than they will permanently "cure" these kinds of vision problems. Glasses are simply external optical aids that provide vision to people with blurred vision caused by refractive errors. Exceptions are the kinds of glasses given to children with crossed eyes (strabismus) or lazy eye (amblyopia). These glasses are used temporarily to help straighten the eyes or improve vision. Not wearing such glasses may lead to permanently defective vision [1].

I'm aware of the consequences without a normal sample. All the popular variant calling tools such as Strelka, VarScan etc require a normal sample. What are the some of the possibilites I have? I'm looking for good sensitivity in exchange for higher false positives.

Post: Imputing missing genotypes from separate genotyping panels What is the current standard for imputing missing genotypes between two genotyping panels? I have two populations genotyped using two different panels (A & B), and I would like to impute all the genotypes in population B for those positions on used in panel A. I've read the examples for impute2, and I think the closest thing to what I am looking for is this example, "Imputation with one unphased reference panel". Simply put, I want to provide a list of SNPs, some variant file for population B, and haplotype information from 1,000 Genomes and get imputed genotypes for each SNP in the list. Is impute2 the state of the art for this?
Passage:
The Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) was a collaboration to create a large reference panel of human haplotypes by combining together sequencing data from multiple cohorts. The reference panel can be used for genotype imputation and phasing in other cohorts, typically genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where genotypes are available from genome-wide SNP microarrays. To do this it is possible to use either the impute server here or at the University of Michigan (links below), or to download from the EGA a slightly reduced copy of the panel for local imputation and phasing, subject to completion of a Data Access Agreement (see external links below).

    "MedXpertQA-Exam": '''Exam: A comatose male patient of middle age is brought to the emergency department with active rectal bleeding. He has no known medical history. His vital signs show: pulse 110/min, blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, respiratory rate 26/min, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. His extremities are cold. Laboratory results reveal: hemoglobin 7.6 g/dL, hematocrit 30%, BUN 33 mg/dL, and normal PT/aPTT. After initial resuscitation with IV fluids and blood transfusion, his vital signs stabilize. A nasogastric tube insertion shows bile-stained fluid without blood. Rectal examination and proctoscopy demonstrate significant active bleeding at an estimated rate of 2-3 mL/min, with no evident hemorrhoids or fissures. What should be the next diagnostic step?
Passage:
The avenue for the interventional radiologist to dictate the clinical course of a GI bleed is largely influenced by location of bleed, overall patient health and other conditions the patient may have, most notably heart and liver functions. For most cases, collaboration between the gastroenterologist and interventional radiologist optimizes patient outcome but again, is largely dictated by anatomical location of the GI bleed. If a patient is evaluated and determined to be a candidate for an interventional procedure, then the bleed is often treated by embolization. Embolization is a process in which the interventional radiologist accesses the culprit bleeding vessel via a small catheter and interrupts blood flow to the site of bleeding via various mechanisms. Side effects of this procedure are minimal but there is a risk of bleeding and infection—though much less than the equivalent surgical procedure. When successful, the procedure often eliminates the bleed and patients can walk

Exam: An 80-year-old woman living alone presents to urgent care with complaints of worsening fatigue over the past two days. She reports needing more daytime naps and feeling persistently tired despite restful sleep at night. She typically carries two bags of groceries from her car to her kitchen but struggled to carry even one bag yesterday, requiring rest after each trip. She denies chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, dysuria, cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. She mentions her teenage grandson visited last week and had a runny nose and cough. On examination, the patient appears fatigued but is not in acute distress. Vital signs, cardiopulmonary examination, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and laboratory tests—including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, cardiac enzymes, and urinalysis—are all normal. She is up to date on vaccinations for Covid-19, influenza, and pneumonia.  What is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient?
Passage:
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is type of NAAT which allows a very small sample of genetic material to be rapidly amplified into millions of copies for study. PCR is more sensitive than either antigen testing or viral culture. Therefore, it can be used to detect virus in those with lower viral shedding, such as older children and adults. It may also be used to detect the disease earlier in at risk-at individuals (such as hospitalized or immunocompromised patients), when the viral burden may still be too low to be identified by traditional techniques. Because of its sensitivity, PCR can also often detect asymptomatic carriers and may remain positive even days after an infection has clinically resolved. Multi-pathogen panels are also available, which can detect the presence of multiple viral infections (including RSV) in a single patient.

    "MedQA-Diag": '''Exam: A 28-year-old female visits her physician for workup of a new onset diastolic murmur found on physical examination. Past medical history is insignificant. Her temperature is 37.0 degrees C, blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The patient denies dyspnea, fatigue, and syncope. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium. This patient is most at risk for what?
Passage:
one-third of patients.Obstruction of cardiac blood flow accounts for the major-ity of presenting symptoms.292 When the tumor is located in the left atrium, symptoms tend to mimic mitral valve disease with dyspnea and pulmonary edema; although more severe presenta-tions with syncopal episodes, hypotension, and sudden cardiac death have been reported from temporary valve orifice occlu-sion. When the tumor is located in the right atrium, symptoms may mimic right heart failure and include hepatomegaly, asci-tes, and peripheral edema. Outflow tract obstruction is rare but may be caused by large ventricular tumors.293Tumor lysis and embolization may also lead to neurologic presentations such as stroke, retinal artery occlusion, or cere-bral aneurysms, particularly in the case of pedunculated tumors and those with frond-like projections.294 Embolic tumor cells are able to lodge and penetrate distant vessel walls via subintimal growth, which leads to weakening of the arterial wall.

Exam: A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressively worsening fatigue for 6 months. During this time, he has also had shortness of breath and palpitations on exertion. He has noticed blood in his stools on three separate occasions in the past 4 months. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease. He drinks two to four beers daily. He does not smoke. His pulse is 95/min and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. Rectal examination is unremarkable. His hemoglobin concentration is 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit is 32%, and mean corpuscular volume is 68 μm3. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's bleeding?
Passage:
C. Usually asymptomatic; complications include 1. 2. Diverticulitis-due to obstructing fecal material; presents with appendicitis-like symptoms in the left lower quadrant 3. Fistula-Inflamed diverticulum ruptures and attaches to a local structure. Colovesicular fistula presents with air (or stool) in urine. III. ANGIODYSPLASIA A. Acquired malformation of mucosa! and submucosal capillary beds B. Usually arises in the cecum and right colon due to high wall tension C. Rupture classically presents as hematochezia in an older adult. IV. A. Autosomal dominant disorder resulting in thin-walled blood vessels, especially in the mouth and GI tract (Fig. 10.24) B. Rupture presents as bleeding. V. A. Ischemic damage to the colon, usually at the splenic flexure (watershed area of superior mesenteric artery [SMA]) B. Atherosclerosis of SMA is the most common cause. C. Presents with postprandial pain and weight loss; infarction results in pain and bloody diarrhea.

Glycopeptide resistance noted.\nBased on the above case summary, what would be an appropriate treatment plan for this patient?
Passage:
The case presented is suggestive of the opportunistic nature of Leuconostoc species. This is a very rare cause of bacteremia linked with nosocomial infections. These types of infections often have a negative, sometimes even fatal, outcome. Often confused with other Gram-positive species (Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp.) and with an innate resistance to glycopeptides, this etiology poses significant difficulties, especially from a diagnostic point of view. Although rarely described in clinical practice, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides infections are most certainly underdiagnosed, given the difficulties posed by microbiological testing. Given the fact that many empiric antimicrobial regimes used for immunocompromised patients contain Vancomycin or Teicoplanin, the persistence of fever in the setting of maximal antimicrobial treatment might raise suspicion for alternative etiologies, including Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides.

Case: A 73-year-old male with a history of high-grade urothelial carcinoma received intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy after a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor. Six months post-treatment, a CT scan revealed a renal mass at the upper pole of the left kidney, measuring 28 × 20 mm, with iso-attenuation on unenhanced CT. The dynamic contrast-enhanced CT indicated homogeneous and gradual enhancement, and MRI showed low signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging and iso-signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging. There were no pseudocapsules, calcifications, fat, or hemorrhagic components observed. Increased fludeoxyglucose uptake was noted with a max standardized uptake value of 9.4. Given these findings in the context of prior BCG therapy, what is the most likely diagnosis for the renal mass?
Passage:
A 73-year-old male presented with gross hematuria. A cystoscopy revealed a sessile bladder tumor beside the right ureteral orifice. He underwent TURBT for pT1 high-grade urothelial carcinoma. He received initial intravesical BCG therapy (six weekly instillations of ImmuCyst at a dose of 81 mg) and a maintenance BCG instillation every 3 months. There was no recurrence of urothelial carcinoma as determined by regular surveillance during the 24 month follow-up period. At 28 months after the initial BCG therapy, a renal mass on the left kidney, which had not been present on the previous CT examination, was detected on follow-up CT (). The renal mass at the upper pole of the left kidney measured 27 × 21 mm. The left renal mass exhibited iso-attenuation (28 HU) compared to the renal parenchyma on an unenhanced CT, and heterogeneous enhancement on a contrast-enhanced CT. An MRI scan revealed heterogeneous, slightly high signal intensity on T2WI, and high signal intensity on DWI. Pseudocapsules, calcifications, fat, and hemorrhagic components were not detected on CT or MRI. An ultrasound-guided 18-gauge needle biopsy of the left renal lesion indicated a necrotizing granuloma with inflammatory cell infiltration. The patient was managed conservatively without any antituberculous agent. The renal lesion subsequently decreased in size and had disappeared after 35 months. No recurrence of the renal lesion was observed during the follow-up period.

Case: A 22-year-old female presents with weakness and numbness in both hands, which began with difficulty moving her right hand at age 20 and has since spread to both upper extremities. Neurological examination reveals atrophy of both hands and feet, decreased muscle tonus, loss of tendon reflexes in the bilateral upper and lower extremities, and loss of sensation on the right side of the body and face. An MRI showed hyperintensity of the left corticospinal tract, and nerve conduction studies indicate decreased conduction velocity in motor and sensory nerves of the upper extremities. Galactosylceramidase activity in white blood cells is significantly decreased. What is the likely diagnosis?
Similar Case:
A 50-year-old female who had previously been diagnosed with adult-onset Krabbe disease was admitted. She had experienced bilateral upper and lower extremity weakness since her 30s. Her symptoms had slowly progressed and neurological examinations when she was 40 years old revealed atrophy of muscles in bilateral lower and upper extremities, loss of superficial sensation in the right hand and both feet and a spastic waddling gait. The conduction velocity of the motor and sensory nerves had decreased bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities. T2 weighted MR images of the brain showed hyperintensities along both corticospinal tracts. The decrease in the white blood cell GALC activity to 0.053 nmol mg–1 h–1 (reference value: 1.93–5.58 nmol mg–1 h–1) was indicative of adult-onset Krabbe disease. A genetic test for GALC mutation was not conducted. When she reached 50 years of age, the weakness had progressed further, and she was admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation.\\nNeurological examinations showed bilateral atrophy in the upper and lower extremities. Her muscle tonus was flaccid in the upper extremities and spastic in the lower extremities. Bilateral sensory deficits were detected in the upper and lower extremities. A nerve conduction study revealed further decrease in the nerve conduction velocity compared with that recorded previously (compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials were not detectable in bilateral median nerves).

Auxiliary Examinations Cranial CT: No obvious abnormalities detected 【Diagnosis and Treatment Process】 Preliminary Diagnosis Tonic-clonic seizure Differential Diagnosis Pseudoseizures: Caused by psychological disturbances rather than cerebral electrical discharges, leading to brain dysfunction. Symptoms may mimic epileptic seizures, including motor, sensory, and consciousness disturbances. Manifestations are varied and often characterized by dramatic self-expressive behaviors such as eye closure, crying, limb tremors, etc. Usually precipitated by emotional stimuli, such as anger or major life stress events. Episodes can be terminated through reassurance and suggestion. The patient's clinical presentation is inconsistent with this; thus, pseudoseizures are excluded. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): Typically presents as sudden motor dysfunction of the limbs, with recovery within 24 hours. Cranial CT typically shows no obvious abnormalities. The patient’s cranial CT revealed cerebral infarction findings, therefore TIA is excluded. Treatment Course After admission, the patient underwent relevant examinations. Cranial MRI revealed no obvious abnormalities. On the day of admission, the patient experienced another seizure after lunch. The patient was placed under ECG monitoring, and treated with intramuscular Luminal (Phenobarbital) 0.1 g every 8 hours (q8h) and oral Sodium Valproate 0.1 g q8h. Brain protective agents were administered, and complications were prevented. Following treatment, the patient's condition stabilized without further seizure episodes. Oral Sodium Valproate was continued, and the patient was discharged in improved condition Final Diagnosis Tonic-clonic seizure. [Analysis and Summary] Epilepsy patients should be diagnosed promptly and treated early. The earlier the treatment, the lesser the brain damage, fewer recurrences, and better prognosis. Medications should be used correctly and rationally, with timely dose adjustments. Individualized treatment should be emphasized. The treatment course should be prolonged, and drug withdrawal should be gradual. Regular medication adherence is crucial, and when necessary, therapeutic efficacy and blood drug concentrations should be monitored. Improper and irregular medication use must be strictly avoided. Eliminating or mitigating primary conditions causing epilepsy, such as intracranial space-occupying lesions, metabolic abnormalities, and infections, is also important for patients with recurrent seizures.
